# MagounStatusBoardUI

A dashboard for weather and MBTA status.

## TODO

__UI:__
* Make it pretty
* Alerts by route
  * Aggregator for Green and Silver lines?
* More detailed weather
  * More prominent in UI
  * Forecast for day/week
* Add a build step (so you can run it in not Chrome/Chromium)
* Use a templating engine or something

A backend service might be nice to 1) hide API keys and 2) aggregating/simplifying other API calls
